# QA Engineer - Tech Challenge


Thank you for your participation in our recruitment process and for taking the time to complete this challenge. We understand the demands of balancing work and job interviews, and we appreciate your effort.

In this repository, you'll find a basic CRUD application designed to collect data about dogs üêï. Your goal is to create and execute a set of test scenarios that thoroughly assess the application.

1. To get started with the application:

- Navigate to the repository's root directory.
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
- After a successful installation, launch the application with `npm start`.
- After a few seconds, you can access the application in your web browser at `localhost:3000`.

2. Task Overview

Your main tasks are as follows:

- Analyze the üêï CRUD application and identify test scenarios covering all aspects. Please note that the application intentionally lacks perfection and detailed documentation.
- Implement automated test scenarios using the Cypress framework, following a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach.
- *(nice to have)* Create a solution for running automated tests in a Docker environment.
- *(nice to have)*  Develop a declarative Jenkins pipeline that runs tests in Docker and generates a comprehensive report.
- Execute the tests and provide a detailed test report. Highlight any issues or defects discovered during the testing process.

Please prioritize adherence to best practices in architecture and design patterns.

Best of luck with the challenge!
